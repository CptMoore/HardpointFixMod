# VisualHardpointLimits
BattleTech mod (using BTML) that limits your loadout possibilities to what mechs have as a hardpoint. Only if a mech can visually have an AC20 as a hardpoint will you be able to add the AC20 to the loadout.

Features:
- restrict weapon loadout that are supported by the mech model (so you have visual feedback on the battlefield)
- fix bad visual loadout selection issues, sometimes the wrong or ugly looking loadout is selected and shown
- added a quickdraw with a second lrm slot on the left torso, but with a reduced slot count

Lets take the Highlander assault mech:
The left Torso has 2 missle hardpoint slots, however only one can mount an LRM20, the other is limited to LRM10. Without this mod you can mount an LRM20 also for the second slot, but it visually would only be showing up as LRM10. With this mod you can't mount the second LRM20 anymore, you have to take either an LRM10 or LRM5. Of course SRMs are still an option.
The left arm is also limited to an LRM15 and you can't mount an LRM20 at all.

This mod also is another PoC for BTML and also adds one more missle hard point for the quickdraw mech using dymnamic manifest manipulation. Don't get your hopes up regarding the missle hardpoints for the quickdraw, the first slot is limited to LRM10 and the second one is limited to LRM5.

Nice consequence of this mod is that smaller mechs and breaching shots get more difficult, and you really need to those hard hitting catapults to make LRMs useful against braced mechs.

There are also currently 3 configuration settings available:
